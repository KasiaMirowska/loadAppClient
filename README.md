# ðŸ§¾ Receipt Processing App

This is a full-stack app for uploading receipt images, processing them via OCR and LLM parsing (using AWS Textract and Bedrock), and storing structured transaction data into Firestore. Built with:

- **React + Redux Toolkit** frontend (deployed to S3)
- **AWS Lambda** serverless functions
  - `receiptProcessor`: triggered by S3 upload
  - `urlGenerator`: generates signed S3 upload URLs
